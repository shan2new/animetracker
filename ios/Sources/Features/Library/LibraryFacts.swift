// The Library's vocabulary, in one place.
//
// The panel's blocking finding was that the two Library surfaces disagreed about the same show:
// "Black Clover — Finished" in All titles and "Black Clover — Returns Oct 2026" under RETURNING one
// screen earlier, with "Finished" carrying the user's LIST state on one screen and the series'
// PRODUCTION state on the other. And "Attack on Titan — No date announced" filed under a section
// headed RETURNING, a heading its own detail screen contradicts three ways.
//
// Both are vocabulary problems, so the vocabulary moved out of the views:
//
//  * `LibrarySection` — the buckets, and the ONE classifier that fills them. `RETURNING` now means
//    "a date is known"; everything announced without one gets its own `ANNOUNCED` section, where
//    "No date announced" is the point rather than a contradiction.
//  * `ReturnFact` — one formatter for "when does it come back", at the shortest honest precision.
//    Four phrasings of one fact ("Returns Oct 2026" / "Returns in 2027" / "Returns Jan 2027" /
//    "Returns Late 2027") appeared within six rows because the ≤17-character branch passed the
//    server's prose through verbatim, capital and all.
//  * `LibraryRowFacts` — the row's two lines, ONE implementation, one rule per surface. The root
//    and All titles each had their own `rowMeta`/`rowLead` pair, which is how two Watching rows in
//    one list ended up disagreeing about whether a progress fact appears at all.
